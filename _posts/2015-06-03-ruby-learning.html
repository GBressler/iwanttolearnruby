An intensive 7 week course for beginners that helps you get started with Ruby programming.  In addition to the main course work, you can take side tracks that introduce you to Git, GitHub, HTTP concepts, RubyGems, Rack and Heroku.  Perhaps the best aspect is the open Google Hangout with a mentor who will help you with the course work and concepts, your system, editor, pair programming and lots more.
